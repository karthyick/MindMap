# MindMap
The Mind Map Application is a dynamic, user-friendly tool designed to help users visually organize and explore hierarchical information by generating a mind map directly from Markdown input.

Users can write or paste Markdown-formatted text in the editor.
Supports headings (#, ##, ###, etc.) and list items (-, *, etc.) for structuring the map.

Each heading and list item becomes a node in the mind map.
